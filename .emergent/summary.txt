<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
On the frontend, based off the W2 generator make me a generator for W9s with the correct pdf form for each year from 2021 - 2024

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The frontend already includes a functional W-2 form generator. The previous agent explored this existing W-2 feature (, ) to understand the implementation pattern. The agent also researched, downloaded, and correctly placed the required W-9 PDF templates for the years 2021-2024 into the  directory after determining that the 2018 revision of the W-9 is applicable for 2021-2023, while 2024 has its own version.

**Last working item**:
    - **Last item agent was working:** The agent had just completed the analysis and planning phase for the W-9 generator feature. It formulated a clear 5-step plan:
        1. Create  for the UI.
        2. Create  for PDF generation.
        3. Create  for the preview functionality.
        4. Update  to add the new route.
        5. Update  to link to the new feature.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Agent Testing Done:** N
    - **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
    - **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding issues. The current work is a new feature request.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress. The next step is to begin the implementation of the W-9 generator.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Task 1 (P0): Implement W-9 Generator Feature.** This task is broken down into the following sub-tasks:
    *   **Create :** Build the React component for the W-9 form page, using  as a template for the structure and fields.
    *   **Create :** Develop the utility to populate and download the final W-9 PDF. This script must load the correct template (, , , or ) based on the user's year selection. Use  as a reference.
    *   **Create :** Implement the logic for generating an in-browser preview of the filled W-9 PDF, mirroring the functionality of .
    *   **Update :** Add a new route in  to render the  component.
    *   **Update :** Add a navigation card or link on the home page () to direct users to the new W-9 generator.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Research & Analysis:**
  - Explored the existing W-2 generator codebase to understand the implementation pattern.
  - Researched and identified the correct IRS W-9 PDF forms for the years 2021-2024.
- **File Preparation:**
  - Downloaded the 2018 and 2024 revisions of the W-9 PDF.
  - Copied and renamed the PDFs into  as , , , and .
- **Planning:**
  - Created a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for the new W-9 generator feature.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The core task is to replicate the functionality of the existing W-2 generator for W-9 forms. Closely follow the code patterns in  and its associated utilities.
- All necessary PDF templates are already available in .
- Your implementation must dynamically select the correct PDF template based on the year (2021-2024) chosen by the user. Remember that 2021-2023 share one PDF revision, while 2024 has a new one.
- Follow the 5-step plan laid out by the previous agent to ensure all parts of the feature are implemented correctly.
